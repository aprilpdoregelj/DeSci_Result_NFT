# DeSci_Result_NFT: Encrypted Clinical Trial Results as NFTs

DeSci_Result_NFT is an innovative platform that transforms FHE-encrypted clinical trial results into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), enabling secure ownership and utilization of sensitive data. This groundbreaking functionality is made possible through **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** (FHE), allowing stakeholders in the healthcare and research sectors to unlock new financing avenues while maintaining confidentiality.

## Tackling the Data Privacy Challenge

In an era where data privacy is paramount, the medical and scientific communities face significant hurdles in sharing and monetizing sensitive clinical trial data. Traditional methods of data publication can expose sensitive information and hinder crucial research progress. Researchers often struggle to find ways to capitalize on their data without compromising patient privacy or violating regulations, creating an urgent need for secure and efficient solutions.

## The FHE Solution

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a revolutionary way to protect data while still allowing computations to be performed on it. By utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries** such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, DeSci_Result_NFT ensures that clinical trial results can be encrypted and transformed into NFTs while remaining confidential. This enables researchers to tokenize their data, allowing it to act as collateral in DeFi protocols or to be traded on NFT marketplaces without exposing sensitive information. The result? A new paradigm in scientific data ownership and monetization.

## Core Functionalities

DeSci_Result_NFT boasts several key features that set it apart:

- **Encrypted Data Tokenization**: Clinical trial data is transformed into secure NFTs, representing ownership and computational rights.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Protects sensitive medical information while still enabling researchers to leverage their data for funding and value realization.
- **DeFi Integration**: Allows clinical data NFTs to be used as collateral in decentralized finance protocols, opening new avenues for funding scientific research.
- **Market Trading**: Facilitates the trading of clinical trial results on NFT marketplaces, enhancing liquidity and visibility for research data/assets.
- **Scientific Financing**: Provides innovative financing options for research projects through the assetization of scientific data.

## Technology Stack

The DeSci_Result_NFT platform leverages a robust technology stack, which includes:

- **Zama SDK**: Core component for confidential computing.
- **Ethereum**: Smart contract platform for deploying NFTs.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development environments for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Concrete & TFHE-rs**: Zama's libraries for implementing fully homomorphic encryption.

   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch all necessary dependencies, including Zama’s FHE libraries.

**Note**: Please do not use `git clone` or any repository URLs to fetch the project.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract** (ensure your Ethereum wallet is set up):

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to create an NFT for clinical trial results:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract DeSci_Result_NFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint public nextTokenId;
    mapping(uint => string) public tokenURIs;

    constructor() ERC721("DeSci_Result_NFT", "DSR") {}

    function mintNFT(address to, string memory tokenURI) public onlyOwner {
        tokenURIs[nextTokenId] = tokenURI;
        _safeMint(to, nextTokenId);
        nextTokenId++;
    }
}
```

This code snippet simplifies the minting process of an NFT, representing tokenized clinical trial results while utilizing OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC721 compliance.
